# DMCP:DFT-based Machine learning method for Catalysis Program
DMCP is developed to implement DFT-based and Machine-learning-accelerated (DFT-ML) scheme for intricate system catalysis.  it is possible to predict the catalytic performance of intricate system catalysis such as DACs and reveal the intrinsic descriptors which determines the underlying catalytic activity of them with appropriate algorithm and train data features.
# Major Features
1. Ten machine learning algorithmsï¼šGBR, KNR, SVR, GPR, FNN, RFR, ETR, KRR, LASSO, and ENR.
2. Multiple methods to improve model accuracy: dataset split, cross validation, repeated trails. 
3. Visualization module for research.
# Prerequisites
1. Generally, you need some data obtained from DFT calculations such as VASP, QE, and CP2K.
2. DMCP requires Python 3 with the packages specified in requirements.txt. This is taken care of by pip.
