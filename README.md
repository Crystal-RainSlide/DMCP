# DMCP:DFT-based Machine learning method for Catalysis Program
DMCP is aimed to implement DFT-based and Machine-learning-accelerated (DFT-ML) scheme for intricate system catalysis. It is possible to predict the catalytic performance of intricate system catalysis such as double-atom catalysts (DACs) and to reveal the intrinsic descriptors which determine the underlying catalytic activity of them with appropriate algorithm and train data features.
# Developer:
DMCP is developed within Prof. Yuzheng Guo's group in Wuhan University, collaborated with Dr. Zhaofu Zhang in Cambridge University.
Core developer: Xuhao Wan, Zhaofu Zhang, Wei Yu, and Yuzheng Guo

# Major Features
1. Ten machine learning algorithms: GBR, KNR, SVR, GPR, FNN, RFR, ETR, KRR, LASSO, and ENR.
2. Multiple methods to improve model accuracy: dataset split, cross validation, repeated trails. 
3. Visualization module for research.
# Prerequisites
1. Generally, you need some data obtained from DFT calculations such as VASP, QE, and CP2K or available material database.
2. DMCP requires Python 3 with the packages specified in requirements.txt. This is taken care of by pip.
